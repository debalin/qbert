### Q*bert!

**Game Description** - This is a 3D rendition of Q*bert. I have tried to stay original to the game, but have changed some aspects and/or introduced new characters.

**Number of levels** - 2.

#### Characters

**Number** - 4.

**Red Egg** - Starts from the top, goes down the board and falls off on reaching the end. Keeps spawning and there can be (at maximum) two red balls at one time on the board.

**Purple Egg / Coily** - Starts from the top, goes down like the red ball and once it reaches the bottom rung, converts to Coily. Coily follows the player around. The player can fool Coily into falling off the board by jumping on the spinning disk when Coily is close. 

**Yellow Egg** - Starts from the top and traverses one side of the board. When it reaches the bottom it retraces its path back up and falls off when it reaches the top. Like the red balls, there can be (at maximum) two yellow balls on the board at one time. 

**Al, the boss** - Starts at random from any of the lowest cubes and follows the player around. It leaves a red trail behind it wherever it goes. If the player falls on the red trail, he will die. Good thing is the red trail slowly fades away with time to give the original cube color.
